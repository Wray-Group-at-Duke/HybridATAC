# HybridATAC
This is the repository for Devens et al. 2023, "Hybrid epigenomes reveal extensive local genetic changes to chromatin accessibility contribute to divergence in embryonic gene expression between species" (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36711588/, DOI:10.1101/2023.01.04.522781). It contains the counts table all reads in all samples falling in reciprocally-lifted peaks, the R code used to conduct the analyses on these data, and the list of GRN genes used for GRN-specific analyses. The raw hybrid ATAC samples can be found at NCBI SRA accession no. PRJNA1000991; the raw same-speciesATAC samples can be found at NCBI SRA accession no. PRJNA828607.
